## Hello, folks! I'm Tulasiram

I have a passion for **JavaScript/Typescript** and website development.
I'm currently a React intern at **ADIMA technologies**.I work mainly with **Javascript**, **Typescript**, **React**, **NodeJS**,and **NextJS**.

## Why have this blog?

> My desire to practice my skills and share my acquired knowledge fuels my endeavors.

I founded this blog as a means to document and share the knowledge and practical wisdom I've acquired during my journey as a software engineer.

Writing and taking notes helps me solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies. I hope my blog can be a useful resource for fellow web developers.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and comments on what I have written.

## Tech stack

This blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

This blog site takes inspiration from leohuynh.dev. I appreciate [Leo Huynh](https://twitter.com/hta218_) and [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for their contribution to this minimal, lightweight, and highly customizable blog starter.

A few major over-engineering-changes from the original repo:

- Upgrading to **React 18**, **Next 13**.

- Monitoring site with [Umami](https://umami.is/)
  website analytics

- Theming in dark mode with colors for better contrast.

- Bumping up `mdx-bundler`, `rehype`/`remark`
  plugins and dependencies to the latest version

See my [repository](https://github.com/tulasiram119/blog) for this blog.
